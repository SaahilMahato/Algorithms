# Implementations of Algorithms and Data Structures in C++, Java and Python

**Disclaimer:**
Most of the programs use integer datatype for inputs and outputs so if your input or
expected output is outside of the integer datatype range the program will not return
correct output. So, change the datatypes as you see fit before using it.
